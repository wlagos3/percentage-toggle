# Percentage Toggle

## By [ZSA](user:6311498)

Forces 2.1 percentage calculation per level

### Notes:

- UI is in beta.

- Editor levels store percentage toggle by name and revision number so if you change the name of a level you will have to re-enable 2.1 percentage calculation
- There is a force override for 2.2 percentage calculation game-wide in the mod settings.
